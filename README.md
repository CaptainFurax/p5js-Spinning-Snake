# p5js-Spinning-Snake
An humble, own private variation of Snake...proudly made on a cloudy sunday with p5.js:)

+ Game : 
  + Each time you'll eat a food brick, the snake will grow
  + Don't touch the borders or your body -> Game Over 
  + When a brick is eaten : the playground/field will turn 90° :
    + on the left when eating a brick arriving by upside or left side
    + on the right when eating a brick arriving by downside or right side
    + control with arrow keys
    + when rotating, arrows direction are kept on the good way [ Player's screen directions ]
  + [.oO° Enjoy Da Demo °Oo.](https://captainfurax.github.io/p5js-Spinning-Snake/)
+ Specs :
  + Javascript + p5.js library
  + 3D Canvas to rotate the playground : a 3D plane rotated on Z-Axis.
  + Playground is an off-screen buffer where the game is drawn[ createGraphics ] - Then apply to 3D Plane. 
+ Tricks :
  + The Snake body is an Array
    + The snake movements are generated by simply removing the first element [ tail ] and adding it to the end of body [ head ] at each cycle.
    + Then, copying coords of the prev. head element to the new one.
    + and Finally, adding a vector [ the direction ]
    + Exception : no need to copy prev. head coords when body size = 1 !
  + Moving function :
  ```javascript
  rollUpd() {
    // slide tail to head !
    this.body.push( this.body.shift() )
    // copying prev. head coords to new one
    if ( this.body.length > 1 ) this.body[ this.body.length-1 ] = this.body[ this.body.length-2 ].copy()
    // adding the direction to the head
    this.getHead().add( vDir )
  }
  ```
